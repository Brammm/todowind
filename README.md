# Todowind

A React example app that goes beyond a simple todo list: a complicated todo list.

The idea is to create an example app that uses multiple, more advanced, React features.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so you have:

`npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.  
`npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

... all the other React-scripts commands.
